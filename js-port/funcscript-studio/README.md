# FuncScript Studio

FuncScript Studio is an interactive playground for the FuncScript runtime. It pairs the
`@tewelde/funcscript` evaluator with the `FuncScriptEditor` React component so you can:

- author and tweak FuncScript expressions with syntax-aware editing
- define the variables each expression depends on and inspect their typed results
- save named collections of variables to your browser's local storage for quick reuse

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server runs on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the Webpack dev server in development mode with hot reloading
- `npm run build` – type-check the project and produce a production build in `dist`
- `npm run preview` – serve the project with Webpack in production mode
- `npm run lint` – run the generated ESLint configuration

## Formulas

Use the header controls to load any saved formula or save the current expression. Saved formulas
are persisted to `window.localStorage` under the key `funscript-studio:formulas`.

## Test Cases

The Test Cases panel (to the right of the editor) lets you capture variable sets for the active
formula. Load a saved case to hydrate the tester, update it after tweaking the variables, or store
additional scenarios with **Save As**. Test cases are kept alongside each formula inside the same
`funscript-studio:formulas` entry in `localStorage`.

## Variable Sets

Variable sets are stored under the key `funscript-studio:variablesets` in `window.localStorage`.
If you want to reset the studio, clear that key (or use the "Delete" button for any saved set).
